# Discord-Pybot
 Made by sebkuip. This is a free time project. Do whatever you want with it.
 If there are issues contact me on discord (sebkuip#3632).
 You should probably move on as there's nothing to find here and it's just a small project. If you find a bug, you can send it in if you want.

 !!!IMPORTANT BEFORE USE!!!
 Create a file named "config.py" and add the following lines.
TOKEN = 'YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE'
PREFIX = 'YOUR PREFIX HERE'
JOINCHANNEL = YOUR JOIN CHANNEL ID HERE
GUILDID = YOUR GUILD ID HERE

You must enter an ID, which can be found by right clicking the server/guild/channel and pressing "Copy ID". If this option is not visible, turn on developer mode in your user settings.
