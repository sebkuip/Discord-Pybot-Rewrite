>>> :exclamation: **How to ask a good question**
~~**--------------------------------------**~~
1. **Don't ask to ask** just post your question/problem.
2. **Use the correct channel** There are several channels, each categorized for their topic. There should be one correct for your question. Please use this and only this channel for your question.
3. **Don't filter with 'Does anyone here know about ....`** If someone doesn't know, they won't answer. No need to already try to filter out.
4. **Provide as much information as possible** If you have logs/screenshots/videos, why not just post them straight away?
5. **Be patient** Don't go around pinging people or sending your issue multiple times. We'll get to you when we have time.
