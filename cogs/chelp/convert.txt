>>> :exclamation: Follow these steps if you want to **Convert Power**
~~**--------------------------------------**~~
**How do I Convert Power?**
1. Replace :battery: With the right Unit of Power,
**>IC2C**= LV,MV,HV,EV,IV
**>Buildcraft**= MJ
**>EnderIO, Industrial Foregoing, Thermal Expansion, GalaticCraft**= FE (RF) but use FE
**>AE2**= Use the Energy Acceptor provided by AE2 itself.
:grey_exclamation: **__Side Note__** :grey_exclamation:
**IC2C to FE/RF = use a Flux Generator itself.**
2. You will need a **:battery: Consumer**, this is the **input** for the power you are generating.
3. You will need an **Energy Bridge**, This converts the Power.
4. You will need a **:battery: Producer**, this is the **Output** for the power you want to create.
